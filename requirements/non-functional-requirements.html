        3.  Non-Functional Requirements
    </h2>
</a>
<p>
    For the purposes of a CSC 308 example, the non-functional requirements for the
    Calendar Tool are organized into these categories and subcategories:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="performance.html#Performance">
            performance
        </a>
    <li>
        <a href="general-characteristics.html#General Characteristics">
            general characteristics
        </a>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Security and Privacy
            <li>
                Simplicity versus Power
        </ul>
</ul>

    </a>

<p>
    All calendar scheduling, viewing, and options commands must execute
    instantaneously, except for the following:
<ul>
    <li>
        the time to execute a meeting scheduling operation must be on the order of
        seconds
    <li>
        the time to execute viewing another user's calendar must be instantaneous,
        except for any delays due to network transmission of data from the central host
        to the local computer
</ul>
<p>
    The time to execute all administrative commands must be instantaneous, except
    for any delays due to network transmission of data from the central host.
<p>
    In general, the performance of Calendar Tool commands that must access data
    across a network is subject to potential network delays.  The Calendar Tool
    must transmit data as fast as is possible on any given network, but delays due
    to external network circumstances are beyond the control of the Calendar Tool.
<p>
    There are no specific requirements for the allowable size of a calendar in
    terms of the number of scheduled items.  A Calendar on the order of thousands
    of items is the maximum expected size during normal use.
<p>
    The maximum expected sizes of the Calendar Tool databases are the following:
<ul>
    <li>
        user database -- up to tens of thousands of records
    <li>
        group database -- up to thousands of records
    <li>
        location database -- up to tens of thousands of records
</ul>
While there may on the order of tens of thousands of registered users, the
expected maximum number of users connected to any given server at any given
time is on the order of hundreds.
<p>
    The Calendar Tool must be able to operate with calendars and databases of sizes
    larger than these normal maximums.  However, the tool need not the meet the
    previously-enumerated time performance requirements for calendars or databases
    larger than normal maximum sizes.

<p>
    Scheduled items with a security setting other than `<tt>Public</tt>' must have
    only the allowed information viewable to any user other than the calendar's
    owner.  The central host passwords of any user must be kept secure from viewing
    or modification by any other Calendar Tool user, and from any user at all on
    the central host.

        <h4>
            3.2.2.  Simplicity versus Power
        </h4>
    </a>
<p>
    On a spectrum of simple-to-use versus powerful, the Calendar Tool is heavily on
    the side of <em>powerful</em>.  Users are assumed to be fully computer literate
    and knowledgeable on the use of computer networks consisting of local computers
    and central data servers.
