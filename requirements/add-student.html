2.2.2.  Adding a New Row of Student Data
</h4>
</a>
<p>
To add a new student to a spreadsheet, the user chooses the '<tt>File</tt>' menu
command. A list of file options will appear and the user chooses '<tt>Add</tt>'
to access another list of the items that can be added. The user chooses 
'<tt>Student</tt>' from the list of items to add a new row of student data; this
will take the form of the following, Figure 1.

<br>

<p>The commands in the '<tt>File</tt>' submenu are the file functions - Save and Add. Saving a
spreadsheet has no implemented response dialog.  The Add submenu has the items that can
be added - Class, Student, Category, and Assignment.</p>
<p>
Figure 2 shows the response to the users selection of the '<tt>File Add Student</tt>' command.

<p>The figure shows a dialog box for adding a new student. The dialog box only
takes in a student name and EMPL ID in two text boxes, and can be confirmed with
the '<tt>Add Student</tt>' button below. Confirming the student will create
a new row of student data in the spreadsheet that can be filled in, as appropriate,
with student grades and other data that the user may add
(see <a href="add-category.html">Add Category</a> section).</p>

<p>
When the user selects the '<tt>Add Student</tt>' button, the system
displays the spreadsheet in Figure 3, with the new student added.

<br>

<p>New students will be added in a default order sorted alphabetically by
	last name for easy organization and integration with school grade systems.
	Students can be added individually as well as by importing a roster from the 
	'<tt>Admin</tt>' menu (see <a href="download-roster.html">Download Roster</a> section)
