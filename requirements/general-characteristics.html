        <li> where your tool overall, or where different features of your tool, fit on the simplicity versus power spectrum; i.e., is it supposed to be simple to use for less sophisticated users or does it have advanced features geared towards "power" users</li>

    Scheduled items with a security setting other than `<tt>Public</tt>' must have
    only the allowed information viewable to any user other than the calendar's
    owner.  The central host passwords of any user must be kept secure from viewing
    or modification by any other Calendar Tool user, and from any user at all on
    the central host.

<p>
    On a spectrum of simple-to-use versus powerful, the Calendar Tool is heavily on
    the side of <em>powerful</em>.  Users are assumed to be fully computer literate
    and knowledgeable on the use of computer networks consisting of local computers
    and central data servers.
