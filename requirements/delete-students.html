In this scenario, we will take a look at how a user can delete a student, via the '<tt>Student</tt>' menu commands.
Deleting a student is useful to remove students from a class spreadsheet that have dropped, or are being dropped from,
the class for whatever reason. Figure 1 shows a sample class ready to delete a student.

To delete a student, the user clicks on the student's row of data in the class spreadsheet. This
will result in the student being highlighted. Then the user chooses the '<tt>Student</tt>' menu
command. A list of options will appear and the user chooses '<tt>Delete Student</tt>' to
remove the student from the class; this will take the form of the following, Figure 2.

<p>There is no dialog result for deleting a student. The result will simply be the class spreadsheet displayed
with the student's data removed from it; this is shown in Figure 3.</p>

Repeating these functions for deleting students allows a user to delete as many students as they want, simply
by clicking on the student and using the delete commands.
