The initial display consists of one window: a standard form of pulldown
command menu and a display of the current grade book.  There is also a quick menu which the user can use to more quickly perform certain key actions. To the right is a graphical representation of grade trends and near the bottom are each category and their associated weight, mean, median, and standard deviation.
