2.2.2.  Adding a New Row of Student Data
</h4>
</a>
<p>
To manually add a new student to a spreadsheet, the user chooses the '<tt>Student</tt>' menu
command. A list of file options will appear and the user chooses '<tt>New Student</tt>' to
add a new row of student data; this will take the form of the following, Figure 1.

<p>The other commands in the '<tt>Student</tt>' submenu are the following - Group Students,
Manage Students, and Delete Student. The functionality of these commands will be mentioned,
but the scenarios will not be covered here. Group Students requires a selection of multiple
students in the spreadsheet and selecting the command, and will allow students to be grouped
together in teams, allowing them to receive team grades and organized according to their
groups. Manage Students allows a user to select one or more students and see the corresponding
student data, graphs, and group. This will allow a user to focus on an individual student
or group of students. Deleting a student simply requires selecting a row of data in the
spreadsheet and selecting the Delete Student command; there is no dialog.
For now we will focus on simply adding a single new student.</p>
<p>
Figure 2 shows the response to the users selection of the '<tt>Student New Student</tt>' command.

<p>The figure shows a dialog box for adding a new student. The dialog box only
takes in a student name and EMPL ID in two text boxes, and can be confirmed with
the '<tt>Add Student</tt>' button below. Confirming the student will create
a new row of student data in the spreadsheet that can be filled in, as appropriate,
with student grades and other data that the user may add
(see <a href="add-category.html">Add Category</a> section).</p>

<p>
When the user selects the '<tt>Add Student</tt>' button, the system
displays the spreadsheet in Figure 3, with the new student added.

<p>New students will be added in a default order sorted alphabetically by
	last name for easy organization and integration with school grade systems. Students
	will also be sorted alphabetically by the groups they are assigned to, if applicable.
	Students can be added individually as well as by importing a roster from the 
	'<tt>Admin</tt>' menu (see <a href="export-students.html">Export Students</a> section)
