<p>
In this scenario, we will take a look at how a user can modify students, via the '<tt>Student</tt>' menu commands.
Modifying students allows a user to search an individual student and modify the student's course, group, and contact
information. Figure 1 shows a sample class that is ready to search for a student to modify.

<p>
To modify a student, the user chooses the '<tt>Student</tt>' menu
command. A list of options will appear and the user chooses '<tt>Manage Students</tt>' to
bring up a dialog for student modification and management; this will take the form of the following, Figure 2.

<p>The other commands in the '<tt>Student</tt>' submenu are the following - New Student, Group Students,
 Delete Student, and Synchronize Roster. The functionality of these commands will be mentioned,
but the scenarios will not be covered here. New Student adds a new row of student data to a class spreadsheet and
requires a student's name and EMPL ID. Group Students requires a selection of multiple
students in the spreadsheet and selecting the command, and will allow students to be grouped
together in teams, allowing them to receive team grades and organized according to their
groups. Deleting a student simply requires selecting a row of data in the
spreadsheet and selecting the Delete Student command; there is no dialog.
For now we will focus on simply modifying a student.</p>
<p>
Figure 3 shows the response to the users selection of the '<tt>Student Manage Students</tt>' command. The user
can select one of the students from a dropdown list at the top, or can search for a particular student by name
or EMPL ID.

<p>The figure shows a dialog box for modifying a student. The dialog box has fields for a 
	Student name, EMPL ID, nickname, group, email, and phone number and can be confirmed with
the '<tt>Confirm</tt>' button below. Editing these fields will edit the information associated
with the student in the course, what group they're in, and how to contact them.</p>

<p>
When the user selects the '<tt>Confirm</tt>' button, the system
displays the spreadsheet in Figure 5, with any changes added. The only changes
that will be displayed in the spreadsheet are changes to the name, EMPL ID, and
nickname for a student.

<p>
Repeating these functions for modifying students allows a user to tweak student data to
be represented and organized in a way that they can better understand and keep track of.
